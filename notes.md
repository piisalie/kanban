kaizen principal <3
## chapter 1 
better instructions about generating a token or if we should or whatever


## Chapter 2
- destroy is very important
- try to move the resource (when they switch to for each for epics/infrastructure)
- the extra mile (important merging of all tf files)

- anyone play with pulumi
- so far this feels like the terraform intro I wish i had when I started with terraform

## Chapter 3
-- layers of terraform
  * [ ] -- lol only copy the files you need
  ordering of things in the docker file seems a little odd 
  I appreciate the use of USER nobody
  I also like that they start with deployment first
  
## chapter 4
" never trust a test you haven't seen fail
ubuntu vs debian?
runner elixir 1.17 instead of 1.16?"
